# BudgetManager

# Overview

Before creating this app, I had 0 experience with mobile applications, which is unfortunate when we consider everyone spends more hours in their phone than their computeters. Knowing how to create mobile application will open many doors and will drastically increase the amount of people that can have access to my software. 

This is a very simple mobile application that allows users to manage their budget. The first screen will prompt users to enter their budget. The second screen allows users to enter expenses. Their total remaining budget will appear on top. 

I decided to create this application because it has a practical use, its simple but challenging enough to complete within a short amount of time, and it allowed me to understand Kotlin and Android Studio fundamentals.
